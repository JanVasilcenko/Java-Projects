# Java-Projects
Here I will post my Java projects with short descriptions and technologies used.

### Calculator
Small Calculator project that can add, substract, divide, multiply, negate and modulus. It can count with simple numbers, but also with floating points numbers.

This project was built with JavaFX using Scene Builder. Patterns used in this project are MVVM and observer.

### First semester project
My first team work and also first programming project was Student Exam planner. It is a Single User System. In this programme teachers and administrators could plan their exams, manage students, rooms and in the end export everything into XML file that could be worked with.

This project includes complete documentation, Activity diagrams, UML diagrams, Group Report (Team report), User Manual and code. Exam planner was developed using Java with Waterfall methodology. JavaFX was used for UI and external CSS file for styling it.

### Second semester project
For the second semester project we worked in team to develop Library System, which helps librarians login and keep track of borrowed and reserved items (Books,Games and Movies). This project is client-server.

This project includes complete documentation including project description, use case descriptions, system sequence diagrams, package diagram, low detailed class diagram, conceptual model of database, logical model of database, UML class diagrams, usability test results, user manual, installation guide, product backlog, planning of each sprint, burndown charts, unit test results and source code.
This project was developed using SCRUM and UP methodology. It includes JavaFX and PostgreSQL database. Communication between client and server is realized by multithreaded RMI. You can find MVVM and observer patterns.

### Third semester project
Third big project was heterogeneous application using Java and C#. Goal of this program was to develop Airline Reservation System, so that passengers can book and manage their flights and so that operators can delay, cancel, modify and add flights.

![AirlineReservationSystemOne](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62397372/108990109-b5ab3380-7696-11eb-946d-65f778912081.png)

![AirlineReservationSystemTwo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62397372/108990236-db383d00-7696-11eb-8752-0e89c4d0a9d7.png)

![AirlineReservationSystemFour](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62397372/108990244-de332d80-7696-11eb-9235-f13f6ca22fa9.png)

This project includes complete documentation including project description, use case diagrams, package diagram, class diagram, sequence diagrams, conceptual model of database, logical model of database, integration test results, test cases, usability test, user manual, installation guide, product backlog, sprint breakdown, burndown chart, link to video demonstration and source code. This system uses three-tier architecture. For communication between client and middleware REST web services are used. For communication between middleware and persistence, sockets with custom protocol are used. C# is used only for client and UI using new tech Blazor.

### Simple chat system
This small project is just socket client-server application implementing simple chat system, showing messages and number of clients connected.

### Kingdom Simulator
This console application is for design pattern practise and together it makes a kingdom simulator. Miners mine random resources and once there is enough valuable transporters bring them to treasure room, the room is guarded by a guard and transporters can only add resources, accountants view the treasure room and count valuables, king takes valuables and once there is enough he throws a party and depletes resources. Design patterns used are flyweight,producer, consumer, adapter, reader, writer, proxy and singleton.

### Heater Simulator
In this project we simulater a heater and there are two thermometers, if the temperature is too low message will appear. User can switch between 3 modes for the heater. It was build using JavaFX and state machine desing pattern is used.
