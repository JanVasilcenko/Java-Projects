1) Set up the database in postgres by giving the database the name "LibrarySystem" and the schema "library".
2) In the "library" schema, copy and paste the sql code found in Appendix H, under the folder Database and execute.
3) Set up the java source code which can be found in Appendix H, under the folder LibrarySystem.
4) The Client must be in a module and the Server must be in another module. This is done so that it can also work
   one separate computers where one comuputer has the database and server, while the other only has the Client.
   Alternatively, the client and server can also be in separate projects.
5) Download and add the external JAR file for JDBC Driver for PostgreSQL or for any other database that you are
   using.
6) In the Server module, under the Adapter package, go to DatabaseInfo class and set the username and password
   for the database in the getters.
7) Run the server and wait for the Connected message from the database, then run the the client.
